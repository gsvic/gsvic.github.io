I am a Ph.D. candidate at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/) at Cornell. 
My research interests lie in the area of database management systems, including learned query optimization and 
distributed query engines. I am part of [Cornell Database Group](https://itrummer.github.io/dbgrouphp/),
advised by [Immanuel Trummer](https://itrummer.github.io/). I hold an M.Sc. in Computing Systems 
from the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens 
(supervised by [Yannis Ioannidis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yannis_Ioannidis)) and a B.Sc. from Ionian University
(supervised by [Dimitrios Tsoumakos](http://www.cslab.ntua.gr/~dtsouma/)).



Prior to Cornell, I was a Senior Software Engineer at [TileDB](https://tiledb.com/). Furthermore, I have held engineering positions at 
[Unravel](https://www.unraveldata.com/), [AISERA](https://aisera.com/), [BEAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(app))
(previously known as TaxiBEAT) and [isMOOD](https://ismood.com/). I have also spent two years as a Researcher at the 
[Computing Systems Laboratory (CSLab)](https://twitter.com/cslab_ntua?lang=en) at the National and Technical University of  Athens.
