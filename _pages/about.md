I am a Ph.D. candidate at Cornell, working with Immanuel Trummer. Previously, I have been a Senior Software Engineer at 
TileDB. Furthermore, I have worked at Unravel, AISERA, BEAT (previously known as TaxiBEAT), and isMOOD. I have also 
spent two years as a Researcher at the Computing Systems Laboratory (CSLab) at the National and Technical University of 
Athens. I hold an M.Sc. in Computing Systems (Software and Hardware) from National and Kapodistrian University of Athens,
and a B.Sc. in Informatics from Ionian University.

My research interests lie in the area of database systems, including federated query engines and query optimization.
